# Authenticating Socket.io Clients

This is the companion repo to [an article](https://medium.com/@rwillt/authenticating-socket-io-clients-f1e6f39a25fe) I wrote about authenticating Socket.io clients with [socketio-auth](https://github.com/facundoolano/socketio-auth). To run the server, just `npm i` in the root directory and then `node server.js`. To run the client, run `npm i` and then `npm start` in the `/client` directory.
